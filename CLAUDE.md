Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.


## Core Rules (Karpathy → Forrest Chang)

### 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface trade-offs.**

Before execution:
- State assumptions explicitly. Ask if unsure.
- If multiple interpretations exist, raise them — don't silently pick one.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when appropriate.
- If something is unclear, stop. Explain what's confusing, then ask.

**Failure mode closed:** Silent wrong assumptions. The agent guessed your intent, and you don't discover the mismatch until three commits later.

### 2. Simplicity First

**Solve the problem with minimal code. No speculative design.**

- Don't build functionality beyond requirements.
- Don't add abstraction layers for code used once.
- Don't add unrequested "flexibility" or "configurability."
- Don't handle errors for scenarios that cannot occur.
- If you wrote 200 lines and 50 would do, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: Would a senior engineer find this overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.

**Failure mode closed:** Over-engineering. A 12-line fix became a 300-line abstraction layer.

### 3. Surgical Changes

**Change only what must be changed. Clean only what you broke.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" neighboring code, comments, or formatting as a side effect.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match the existing code style, even if you prefer a different one.
- If you find unrelated dead code — mention it, but don't delete it.

When your change creates dead code:
- Delete imports, variables, and functions that *your changes* made unused.
- Don't delete pre-existing dead code unless asked.

Test: Every changed line should directly correspond to a user requirement.

**Failure mode closed:** Orthogonal damage. While fixing an unrelated bug, the agent formatted the entire file and renamed variables.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until met.**

Convert tasks into verifiable goals:

| Original Instruction | Translated Goal |
|---|---|
| "Add validation" | "Write a test that verifies invalid inputs are rejected, then make it pass" |
| "Fix the bug" | "Write a test that reproduces the bug, then make it pass" |
| "Refactor X" | "Make sure all tests pass before and after the refactor" |

For multi-step tasks, write a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → Verify: [check]
2. [Step] → Verify: [check]
3. [Step] → Verify: [check]
```

Good success criteria let the agent iterate autonomously. Weak criteria ("just make it work") lead to frequent clarification requests.

**Failure mode closed:** Execution without validation. The agent did what you said, but the feature still doesn't work.

## Extended Rules (Mnimiy, May 2026)

### 5. Don't Use Models for Non-Language Work

**Retries, routing, rate-limiting, arithmetic, timing — use deterministic code, not prompts.**

- Retry strategies, routing decisions, alert thresholds are deterministic logic — write them in code.
- Don't use LLM loops for arithmetic, sorting, counting, or other enumerable operations.
- A prompt deciding "should we retry this 503?" will read the entire request body, making retry behavior random.

**Failure mode closed:** Unstable logic. Problems that application code should solve are handed to an LLM loop.

### 6. Hard Token Budget, No Exceptions

**Set an upper limit per loop. When the same 8KB of input has been chewed on for 90 minutes, stop and step back.**

- If debugging the same issue exceeds 5 rounds, stop and report: "Cannot resolve independently — human intervention needed."
- Don't try new approaches indefinitely — this exhausts token budgets.
- Estimate token consumption before starting a task. If over budget, stop and ask.

**Failure mode closed:** Debug spiral. 90 minutes looping through the same error message, with solutions you already rejected 40 messages ago reappearing.

### 7. Surface Conflicts, Don't Average

**When two parts of the codebase disagree, pick one and explain why. Doing both doubles the bug surface.**

- Two error-handling patterns? Pick one, state why.
- Two state-storage approaches? Pick one, stay consistent.
- Mixed code styles? Don't create a third — choose an existing one.

**Failure mode closed:** Pattern pollution. The codebase mixes async/await try/catch with global error boundaries. The agent's new code uses both. Errors get swallowed twice.

### 8. Read Before You Write

**Before adding code, read neighboring code first. If a new function is identical to an existing one, the import order decides which runs.**

- Before modifying a function, read its callers to understand context.
- Before adding a new utility function, search whether an alternative already exists.
- Before creating a new file, look at sibling files in the same directory.

**Failure mode closed:** Duplicate function. The agent added a new function right next to an identical existing one. Which one runs depends on import order.

### 9. Test for Correctness, Not Just "Passing"

**A function that returns a constant and passes its test is not truly tested. Assertions must bind to behavior, not shape.**

- Check whether a test actually verifies behavior or just checks that a return value exists.
- A test that can never fail provides zero protection in production.
- Coverage is not the goal — the goal is confidence to change code safely.

**Failure mode closed:** Shape testing. A function returns a constant; the test checks "function has a return value." All green. Auth is broken in production.

### 10. Long-Running Operations Need Checkpoints

**Multi-step refactors and migrations should commit results between steps, so one failure doesn't require rolling back six steps.**

- After completing each major step, summarize what was done and confirm before continuing.
- For changes spanning 5+ files, group logically and validate incrementally.
- On error, roll back only to the last checkpoint, not to the start.

**Failure mode closed:** Cascading breakage. Step 4 of a 6-step refactor fails, but steps 5 and 6 are already stacked on top of the broken state.

### 11. Convention Over Innovation

**In projects with established patterns, use existing patterns — even if your approach is "better." Two patterns are always worse than one.**

- Codebase uses class components? Don't introduce hooks (unless asked to refactor).
- Codebase uses function A for error handling? Don't invent function B.
- Matching is optimal by default, unless there's a clear reason to break.

**Failure mode closed:** Paradigm drift. The agent introduced hooks into a class-component codebase. They work, but the test infrastructure assumes `componentDidMount` and silently breaks.

### 12. Failure Must Be Visible, Not Silent

**Surface every skipped record, every rolled-back transaction, every constraint violation. Never report success while silently bypassing problems.**

- A migration that "completed successfully" but skipped 14% of records (due to constraint violations) — that's a bug, not a success.
- try/catch should not swallow exceptions and report success.
- Partial failures, skipped rows, truncated output, exhausted retries — all must be reported.

**Failure mode closed:** Lying success. A database migration "completed successfully" but silently skipped 14% of records. The issue isn't discovered until reports start breaking 11 days later.

## Verification Checklist

Before returning task completion, confirm each item:

- [ ] Have I explicitly stated my assumptions?
- [ ] Are there any changes beyond the stated scope? If so, revert or justify.
- [ ] Is there any test that passes without truly verifying behavior? Recheck assertions.
- [ ] Are there any partial failures, skipped records, or truncated outputs? Surface them in the summary.

## Project-Specific Rules

```
<!-- Add repository-specific rules here. Keep concise, ideally under 50 lines.
Example:
- Stack: TypeScript + Next.js 15 + Prisma + Postgres
- Test: pnpm test (Vitest, add --run in CI)
- Lint: run pnpm lint:fix before each commit
- Don't touch migrations/ — managed by Prisma CLI
-->
```

---

**Signs these principles are working:**
- Fewer unnecessary changes in diffs — only requested changes appear
- Less rewriting due to overcomplexity — first attempts are simple enough
- Shorter debugging loops — hard token budgets enforce discipline
- Higher test quality — behavior verification instead of shape-checking
- Faster bug discovery — fewer silent failures, more visible ones

------

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
